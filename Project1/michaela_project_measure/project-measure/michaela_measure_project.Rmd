<!-- But for me I have a primary research question that consists of two subquestions. My first subquestion is "How does ’height’ compare to ’arm span’ between males and females?" where I compare the two using cor.test(), plots, and a correlation matrix. -->

<!-- For my second subquestion, I have "How many average ’head height’ lengths are males and females relative to their respective, -->
<!-- average ’height’?" where I compare the means of both samples using t.test() and simple division. -->


# Loading data
```{r, chunk-file-path}
# # Run those before the whole document
# Sys.setenv(WSU_SANDBOX_HOST = "md5.mshaffer.com");
# Sys.setenv(WSU_SANDBOX_DATABASE = "wsu_sandbox_db");
# Sys.setenv(WSU_SANDBOX_USER = "wsu_sandox_user");
# Sys.setenv(WSU_SANDBOX_PASSWD = "!WSUCougars");
library(humanVerseWSU);

path.measure = "C:/_git_/SECRETS/";  
file.measure = paste0(path.measure,"measure-students.txt");

```


# Data Cleanup
## Create data frame measure
This step saves the original data in a data frame called measure.raw. Another data frame is created as well, measure.clean, which is going to be modified.
```{r, chunk-get-your-data}
# create data frame

measure.raw = read.csv(file.measure, header=TRUE, sep="|");
measure.raw = as.data.frame(measure.raw);

measure.clean = measure.raw;
measure.clean = as.data.frame(measure.clean);

dim(measure.clean);
summary(measure.clean);

measure.clean;
```

## Remove Duplicates
```{r, chunk-remove-duplicates}

# Instructor function
measure.clean = removeDuplicatesFromDataFrameAllColumns(measure.clean);
measure.clean;
```




## Average values
For data points that have a right and left measurement, the average will be taken. When there is only one measurement, that one will be taken. This enables to get a uniform set of data without missing values for those entries.
```{r, chunk-get-average-values}

# take one given value of left or right OR take the average of them both when given

getOne = c("hand.length", "hand.width", "hand.elbow", "elbow.armpit", "arm.reach", "foot.length", "floor.kneepit", "floor.hip", "floor.armpit");
n.rows = dim(measure.clean)[1];

for(one in getOne)
  {
  measure.clean[one] = NA;
  }
  
for(i in 1:n.rows)
  {  
  measure.row = measure.clean[i,];
  for(one in getOne)
    {
    nidx = getIndexOfDataFrameColumns(measure.clean, one);
    
    myleft = paste0(one,".left");
      lidx = getIndexOfDataFrameColumns(measure.row, myleft);
    myright = paste0(one,".right");
      ridx = getIndexOfDataFrameColumns(measure.row, myleft);
    
      # print(paste0(
      #             "left: ",myleft," --> ",lidx,
      #             " right: ",myright," --> ",ridx
      #             )
      #       );
      
      row.m = mean(
            c(as.numeric(unlist(measure.row[lidx])),
            as.numeric(unlist(measure.row[ridx]))),
            na.rm=TRUE);
      
    measure.clean[i,nidx] =  row.m;
    }
  }

#str(measure); # lot's of columns ...

measure.clean;
```


## Leave only average values
In the step above new columns have been created and added to the data frame measure.clean with the average values of left and right. I only want to keep those and get rid of the lett and right columns instead. This re-arrangement will be done now.
```{r, chunk-re-arranging-data-frame}

# determine if this separation above will give the same as separating by head proportions
measure.clean = measure.clean[,-(7:16), drop=FALSE];
measure.clean = measure.clean[,-(8:13), drop=FALSE];
measure.clean = measure.clean[,-(9:10), drop=FALSE];


# re-arrange columns
measure.clean = measure.clean[,c(1,2,3,4,5,6,20,21,22,23,24,7,25,26,27,8,28,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)];

measure.clean;
```


## Get rid of 'notes' column
```{r, chunk-delete-notes-column}

# 428 entries total
# remove notes column
measure.clean <- measure.clean[,1:27];
```



## Unity among gender notation
In the collected data, there have been used different notations for 'female' and 'male'. This will cause problems in further analyses and it therefore needs to be adjusted to an overall standard.
```{r, chunk-gender}

# make same gender notation
measure.clean$gender <- tolower(measure.clean$gender);

measure.clean$gender[measure.clean$gender == 'f'] <- 'female';
measure.clean$gender[measure.clean$gender == 'm'] <- 'male';

measure.clean;
```


## Converting units to cm
Since not all data has been collected in the same units, this has to be fixed in order to compare the data properly. Units used are inches and cm. I have decided to go with cm, so I convert inches to cm, where 1 inch equals to 2.54 cm.
```{r, chunk-unit-conversion}

# same units - convert to cm - 1 inch is 2.54 cm
for (row in 1:nrow(measure.clean)) { # Iterate through each row
  if (measure.clean$units[row] == 'inches' || measure.clean$units[row] == 'in' || measure.clean$units[row] == 'Inch') { # When units is in cm
    measure.clean[row, 4:17] <- measure.clean[row, 4:17]*2.54; # Replace measurements with cm equivalent
    measure.clean$units[row] <- 'cm';
  }
}

measure.clean;
```


## Remove Outliers
This step enables to clean up the data even more such that it has only accurate and reasonable data.
```{r, chunk-outliers}
# measure.clean <- na.omit(measure.clean);
# measure.clean;
# 
# for (columns in 4:17) {
#    Q1 <- quantile(measure.clean[[columns]], 0.25);
#    Q3 <- quantile(measure.clean[[columns]], 0.75);
#    IQR <- IQR(measure.clean[[columns]]);
# # boxplot(measure.clean$hand.length);
#    no_outliers <- subset(measure.clean, measure.clean[[columns]]>(Q1 - 1.5*IQR) & measure.clean[[columns]]<(Q3 +1.5*IQR));
# # boxplot(no_outliers$hand.length);
# }
# 
# #colnames(measure.clean)
# 
# measure.clean;
#);


```


## Remove NA values
Now since we have rearranged, reassigned and removed outliers, all remaining data that has no values and is therefore incomplete can be removed. It can be removed or only for those columns that we will be working on in the analysis, so that not too much data gets deleted.
```{r, chunk-remove-NA}

# remove remaining NA rows
measure.clean.n <- na.omit(measure.clean);
measure.clean.n; # 239 entries left
```




# Analysis 
## Proportions of head vs whole body
### Create a subset with only important variables for the analysis
```{r, chunk-subset-for-analysis}

measure.subset <- as.data.frame(measure.clean);
measure.subset = measure.subset[,-(1:3), drop=FALSE];
measure.subset = measure.subset[,-(3:8), drop=FALSE];
measure.subset = measure.subset[,-(4:13), drop=FALSE];
measure.subset = measure.subset[,-(6:8), drop=FALSE];
measure.subset;
```

### Create new data frame 'measure.proportions' to work on analysis
```{r, chunk-data-frame-analysis}
# new data frame
measure.proportions <- as.data.frame(measure.subset);
measure.proportions <- na.omit(measure.proportions);
measure.proportions;
```

## Correlation?
```{r}
# correlation
cor.test(measure.proportions$height.NA, measure.proportions$head.height.NA);
cor.test(measure.proportions$height.NA, measure.proportions$age);
cor.test(measure.proportions$height.NA, measure.proportions$arm.span.NA);

# t-test
t.test(measure.proportions$height.NA, measure.proportions$head.height.NA);
t.test(measure.proportions$height.NA, measure.proportions$age);
t.test(measure.proportions$height.NA, measure.proportions$arm.span.NA);

```




```{r}
plot(measure.proportions$head.height.NA, measure.proportions$height.NA);
```


### Assign proportions group
This analysis is based on the calculation of how many times the head height fits into the whole body height. Then the proportion values will be grouped into different groups, these are:
Group 'F': There the person is most likely a female adult because the proportions are bigger than what kids usually have, which is above 6.5.
Group 'M': There the person is most likely a male adult because the proportions are bigger than what kids usually have, which is above 6.5.
Group 'K': There the person is most likely a child (male or female) because the proportions are smaller or equal to 6.5. 
```{r, chunk-proportions-group}
# create proportion: how many times is the head in the body
measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height = measure.proportions$height.NA/measure.proportions$head.height.NA;

# group based on proportions
measure.proportions$proportions.group[measure.proportions$gender == 'female' & measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height > 6.5] <- 'F'; 
measure.proportions$proportions.group[measure.proportions$gender == 'male' & measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height > 6.5] <- 'M'; 
measure.proportions$proportions.group[measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height <= 6.5] <- 'K';

measure.proportions;
```

### Assign age group
This analysis is based on the age and gender of a person. Then these groups are created:
Group 'F': There the person is female and 11 years or older.
Group 'M': There the person is male and 11 years or older.
Group 'K': There the person is a child (male or female) because the age is 10 or younger. 
```{r, chunk-age-group}
# group into adolescent female, male and child
measure.proportions$age.group[measure.proportions$gender == 'female' & measure.proportions$age > 10] <- 'F';
measure.proportions$age.group[measure.proportions$gender == 'male' & measure.proportions$age > 10] <- 'M';
measure.proportions$age.group[measure.proportions$age < 11] <- 'K';

measure.proportions;
```

### Create data frame with newly created 3 columns
```{r, chunk-data-analysis}
# new data frame
measure.proportions.new <- measure.proportions[6:8];

measure.proportions.new <- na.omit(measure.proportions.new);
measure.proportions.new;
```

### Do group age and proportions match?
Here the analysis gets interesting. Now we compare if the two ways of assigning groups are matching in the assigned groups.
```{r, chunk-group-age-vs-proportions}
# now let's see if the 2 groupings give the same answer
match = 0;


for (row in 1:nrow(measure.proportions.new)) { # Iterate through each row
 if (measure.proportions.new$proportions.group[row] == measure.proportions.new$age.group[row]) { # When grouping is the same
    match = match + 1; # Add a match
 }
}

rows = nrow(measure.proportions.new);
match.ratio = match/rows;

match.percentage = match.ratio*100;
match.percentage;
```

### What percentage of people is considered 'heroic'
This analysis is based on the calculation of how many times the head height fits into the whole body height. Then the proportion values will be grouped into different groups, these are:
Group 'F': There the person is most likely a female adult because the proportions are bigger than what kids usually have, which is above 6.5 and below or equal to 8.5. 
Group 'M': There the person is most likely a male adult because the proportions are bigger than what kids usually have, which is above 6.5 and below or equal to 8.5. 
Group 'K': There the person is most likely a child (male or female) because the proportions are smaller or equal to 6.5. 
Group 'H': There the person is most likely an adult because the proportions are heroic above 8.5. 
```{r, chunk-heroic}

# group based on proportions
measure.proportions$proportions.group.2[measure.proportions$gender == 'female' & measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height > 6.5 & measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height <= 8.5] <- 'F';
measure.proportions$proportions.group.2[measure.proportions$gender == 'male' & measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height > 6.5 & measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height <= 8.5] <- 'M';
measure.proportions$proportions.group.2[measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height <= 6.5] <- 'K';
measure.proportions$proportions.group.2[measure.proportions$proportions.head.and.height > 8.5] <- 'H';

measure.proportions;


# new data frame
measure.proportions.new2 <- measure.proportions[9];
measure.proportions.new2 <- na.omit(measure.proportions.new2);
measure.proportions.new2;


# now let's see what proportion of people is considered heroic
match.h = 0;

for (row in 1:nrow(measure.proportions.new2)) { # Iterate through each row
 if (measure.proportions.new2$proportions.group.2[row] == 'H') { # When grouping is heroic
    match.h = match.h + 1; # Add a match
 }
}

rows = nrow(measure.proportions.new2);
match.h.ratio = match.h/rows;

match.h.ratio;
match.h.percentage = match.h.ratio*100;
match.h.percentage;

# print('There are ', match.h.percentage, ' of people considered heroic. This means they have a head/hight ratio above 8.5!');
```



### How does arm span relate to height?
```{r, chunk-arm-span}

# Is there a linear relationship between the two variables? -> Yes
plot(measure.proportions$arm.span.NA, measure.proportions$height.NA);

summary(measure.proportions);
```


## Correlation table
```{r, chunk-correlation-table}

buildLatexCorrelationTable = function(myData, 
                                myFile = paste0(getwd(),"/","table-correlation.tex"),
                                myLabel = "table:correlation",
                                myCaption = "Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Analysis",
                                myNames = colnames(myData),
                                rotateTable=TRUE,
                                rowDivider = TRUE,
                                width.table = 0.90,
                                width.names = "5cm", # this includes space to M
                                space.M.SD = "5mm",
                                space.SD.corr = "10mm",
                                showOnes = "left" # options are "center" or "left" or NULL
                                )

buildLatexCorrelationTable(measure.clean[6:8]);

head(measure.clean[6:8]);

```

prepare measure data clean (instructor), compare height and arm.reach
probably still some bad data
## Plotting
```{r}
# hist(jobs$job.count, breaks = 20, col = "green", border = "darkgreen",main = paste("Histogram of job.count of the job table"), xlab = paste("job.count") , ylab = paste("Frequency"));
# 
# boxplot(jobs$job.count, col = "black",main = paste("Boxplot of job.count of the job table"), notch = TRUE, varwidth = TRUE, ylab = paste("job.count"));
